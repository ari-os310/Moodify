# Moodify

## What is *Moodify*?

Moodify wants you to stop by, pick a mood and affirmation and give it a listen! Let's soothe what you're feeling. Itâ€™s natural to feel deflated, but we all deserve to remember our strength  and reconnect with our power. 

## Technology

*Built with*

- Frontend UI: ReactJS
- Backend API: PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, NodeJS
- Integrating: Watson Text-to-Speech API, OAuth, Auth0

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- User can select from available moods
- Available moods offer unique lists of affirmations
- User can click an affirmation to play message

## Additional Nice-to-Have Features

- User Login (OAuth/Auth0)
- Logged in users may edit/create/delete affirmations
- Dropdown to select from different voices to play
- Grounding Exercises post-affirmation

## Technical Risks

Adjustments plan :

- Integrating Watson Text-to-Speech might prove more difficult than I anticipate
  - Will troubleshoot using docs
  - If cannot resolve with docs, will reach out to mentor and/or volunteer for help
- I run out of time and get stuck on API implementation
  - App will just call one voice for all affirmations
- Not enough time for OAuth/Auth0
  - Users will be able to play affirmations but won't be able to modify them
